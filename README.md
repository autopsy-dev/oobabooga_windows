# oobabooga's Text Generation WebUI

This is a fork of oobabooga's Text Generation WebUI, which provides a web interface for generating text using a large language model.
Description

The web interface allows users to input a starting prompt and generate text using a large language model (LLM). The LLM is trained on a large corpus of text and is capable of generating coherent and fluent text based on the input prompt.

This fork improves the model selection options by adding more pre-trained models to choose from. This allows users to generate text using different models and compare their output.

#Usage

```
run start windows.bat 
simply select or download a model.
```

#Credits

This web interface was originally created by oobabooga and has been improved by the contributors of this fork. The pre-trained models used in this project were created by various researchers and are listed in the models directory.
